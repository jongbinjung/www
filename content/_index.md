I believe in the power of simplicity and precision as tools for making better
decisions.

I studied Computational Social Science and Decision Analysis at
[Stanford MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu) as part of the [Stanford
Computational Policy lab](https://policylab.stanford.edu),
and studied operations research and management science at [Yonsei
Business School](https://ysb.yonsei.ac.kr) in Seoul, Korea.
