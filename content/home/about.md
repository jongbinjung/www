I am currently a PhD student in [Management Science & Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/student-spotlight-jongbin-jung)
at Stanford University.
My work is in the cross-section of Decision Analysis and
Computational Social Science. I prefer clarity and transparency to complexity
and obscurity, and my thesis is based on the idea that the former lead people
to make better decisions.

I blog about [technical stuff](http://blog.jongbin.com) and life with
[my daughter](http://dam.jongbin.com) (mostly in Korean), and provide
workshops, tutorials, and crash courses on various topics related to
Computational Social Science.
